# Random Gif Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates random GIFs using the Giphy API. It allows users to click a button and view a random GIF on their screen or search for a specific gif. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works

When the user clicks the "Randomize" button or enters an input into the search box, the application makes a request to the Giphy API to fetch a GIF. It then displays the GIF on the webpage. The loading animation is shown while the GIF is being fetched.

## Installation
